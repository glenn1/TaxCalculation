TaxCalculation
==============

Create a console-based application named TaxCalculation. Include two overloaded methods-one that accepts a price
and a tax rate expressed as doubles(for example, 79.95 and 0.06, where0.06 represents 6%), and one that accepts
 a price as double and a tax rate as an integer(for example 79.95, and 6, where 6 also represents 6%). Include
 a Main() method that demonstrates each method calculates the same tax amount appropriately.
